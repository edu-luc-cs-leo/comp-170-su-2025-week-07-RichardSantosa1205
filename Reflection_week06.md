After reviewing the solutions and comparing it to my own code, it is evident that the solutions were far more detailed in the explanation it gives as to make it more clear to the readers what is happening at every step. Upon deeper investigation it is also discovered that there were some minor but not significant differences in coding practics, whilst the solution opts for a more clearer logic and descriptive way of coding my code is a more streamlined version of it, though it prforms the objctive just fine, it does however become a problem shouuld the project need to be revisited or someone who is inexperienced tries to read and understand it. another area of improvement is the code structure and execution flow. My code does not include a "main()" function or an "if __name__ == "__main__":" block, which is a common best practice in Python for ensuring that functions are only run when the script is executed directly. Overall I believe that this weeks home work was a success seeing that I was able to make the code run and execute the objective, however as mentioned before thatre are areas of improvement to be done for future work.
